<h1>About the project</h1>
This is the second challenge from Jonas Schmedtman's <em>The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Build Real Projects!</em>.
<h2>Description</h2>
It's a web based budget application that allows the user to keep track of their monthly budget (income/expenses). It is very easy to use as it has a simple and to the point user interface.
<h2>Information</h2>
The HTML and CSS for this were provided by the course teacher. I only worked on the JS code.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
By building this application I've strengthened my grasp on DOM manipulation, I've learned about IIFE's and JavaScrips principles and conventions.

This is a web based budget application that allows you to keep track of your monthly. The HTML&CSS on this weren't made by me, this application was part of a Udemy JavaScript course I was taking. This was a pretty big project that used everything I have learned about JS so far in the course. Therefore, the JS code isn't written by me from scratch but I've learned so much and I expanded my knowledge on JavaScript a lot and I will put it better in practice in my next projects.
